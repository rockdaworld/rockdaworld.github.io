        <h1>Easy and Light</h1>
        <p>
        Today (April 27th) marks the start of my 22nd year of life. I was going to write how the first thought I had of this event was how old I felt, but that's not actually true. The moment the clock struck midnight on the 27th, I felt like I have been incredibly blessed in all my life. I am far, far from the best friend and even further from being the best person, so I had no expectations of anything really special happening on my birthday because of how unworthy I felt of it. However, one thing I'm learning even more through today is the fact that love isn't this linear exchange of services for emotion. It's not necessarily earned or not earned. The amount you pour into someone's life doesn't create a linear relationship with the love that they or you give each other. It might be less than or much greater than what you might expect. The love that I received from my family and friends seemed so much greater than what I think I deserve from anyone. Whether it was a little message or something more, I felt inadequate and unworthy to receive any of it. But despite how I felt, the love was still given and that reminded me of just how truly blessed I am in every aspect of my life. So I thank each and every one of you who poured into me and even those who are just reading this, for the love that you've shown me, for how special this day has become.

        Life has not been so easy recently. Honestly, for my post-pubescent period of life it really hasn't ever been easy. I am now starting to understand that suffering and difficulty are not the same. In some ways, I may be suffering now, but I feel as if my life is easier than it ever has been, that my burdens are light. As of my recent posts, I've tried my best to not include my faith in what I write for many reasons, but when it comes to sharing about this, there's only one way I can really do it.

        A bit of a "season verse" for myself has been Matthew chapter 11, verses 28-30, and more specifically, verse 30. In the ESV version it goes, "For my yolk is easy, and my burden is light." Jesus here is speaking to the crowds in Galilee, to the regular people of the city. He's saying to a crowd of people who are likely to be impoverished by today's standards, beat down by those who hold power, looking for someone to save them. However, Jesus isn't what the Jews of the time imagined their savior to be. They imagined a literal king of a nation. One who would rise to power and save them from both physical oppression and the pain and suffering of the world
        </p>

        What Jesus is actually offering here, and he highlights it in verse 30, is a salvation from the pain and suffering of the world, but in a different light or way. In the only way that is good, merciful, and above all, the most loving. Here, Jesus is saying that for those who follow him, their yoke will be easy. This meaning that the responsibilities in which we are called to uphold and the choices that we have to make, they will be easy. He also says that our burdens will be light. That through the highs and lows, the pressures that we put on ourselves and that we think the world puts on us will be taken off, as the expectations when living in the Kingdom of God are different to those of the world. This is true salvation. Not what the Jews expected, but what they, and us, really needed.

        Making the choice to become a disciple of Christ, one who follows him to learn and then apply what they have learned, has brought me into this light of salvation. Suffering is a universal constant, but I've learned that that doesn't necessitate a hard and overburdensome life. I look around and see that nothing else in this world can provide this. No other religion, philosophy, ideology, not even science. Purpose, meaning, and hope can only truly be found in and through Christ.

        I am so incredibly grateful for all that I have been given, for I really have earned nothing on my own. I am especially thankful for the people I have in my life. The friends, the family, even the acquaintances. Those who challenge me and encourage me, those who pour their love into me. I know that none of us are perfect, but the fact that we are trying; trying to love God, to love others, gives me profound joy.

        In this point I was going to talk about my future, specifically in the aspects of career. Instead, I'll share about who I want to be as a person. Of course I want to be working hard to figure out the aspects of my career and what I want to do with my life in those terms, but I want to be doing that and every other thing in my life in the light of the growing love that I have for God and for others. When the disciples asked Jesus what the greatest commandment was, he replied that it was to love God. Right after he said this, he said the next greatest is to love others. These must be the most important parts of our lives, and I want to become a person who desires these things above all else. This is a general idea of the general person I want to be, and the specifics will be dove into in the future.

        Again, for each and every one of you, I thank you for being such a great blessing in my life, for making this day so special, so blessed. Even if you do not know me well, the fact that you read this drives me to write more, so these words are not empty whatsoever. 
        </p>

        I will sign off with a question to you: What type of person do you want to be? Is the path that you are on one that will leave you off the best at the end of your life? And most importantly, how are you blessed in your life?

        With Love, Mr Rock.
